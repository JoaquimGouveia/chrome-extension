Extension that calculates user's average GPA in Ladok

I want to learn how to create a chrome-extension. An ideia that I have been contemplating for a while is an extension that can interact with Ladok. Ladok is a Swedish academic administration system used by universities and colleges to manage student information, such as registration, grades, and course credits. What I would like to create is something that can, given the information in the page, automatically calculate the average GPA of the user.
